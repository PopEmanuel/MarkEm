## System for Managing Academic Information
The process of managing informaton required in an academic environment is a time-consuming actvity.  <br/>
In order to produce and manage this information, using a dedicated software application is from far the best solution.  <br/>
Mainly it is about classroom activities engaging students and teachers. <br/>
The System will keep track of information for each student starting with the first undergraduate year and finishing with the last one or with the last master year.<br/>
Each faculty may have different specialisations both for the undergraduate and master degrees; a student is enrolled in one of these.<br/>
Each faculty year will have a contract of studies, a curriculum (list of mandatory disciplines + 1 optional discipline).<br/>
